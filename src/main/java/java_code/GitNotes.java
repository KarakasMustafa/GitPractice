    git is a version control tool,
    it keeps track of changes that were made,
    git remembers who did changes, when and what kind of changes,
    it helps to collaborate, so multiple developers can easily work together on the same project.
    Also, git is a distributed version control system(DVCS).

    Main version of the project will be in the cloud ( for example github)

    github : is a google drive for git projects/repositories

    for project we create a git repository.
    We have local repository( on your computer)
    and we have remote repository (on github)

    git knows about changes in our projects
    github works as a cloud storage for our projects.

    The process of getting a copy of projects call cloning

    git clone - stands for getting a copy of projects from remote
